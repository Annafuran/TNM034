# TNM034

A project for the course TNM034, Advanced Image Processing at Link√∂ping University.

The project was conducted with the aim of implementing a face recognition algorithm. The algorithm was tested on images with modifications such as rotation, 
scaling and change in tone value. 

The algorithm was implemented using MatLab.
